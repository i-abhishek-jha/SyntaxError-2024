2. Guided Breathing Exercise
A calming tool that guides users through breathing exercises with visual cues (like expanding/contracting circles) or optional audio prompts.

3. Motivational Quote Generator
Displays a new motivational quote or positive affirmation every time the page is visited or refreshed, dynamically fetched from APIs like ZenQuotes or FavQs.

4. Journaling Prompt

Relax with background sounds like rain, waves, or nature sounds while journaling or meditating, powered by the Web Audio API or FreeSound API.

Reason for Project Failure
The project faced challenges when shifting from Firebase to MongoDB. Firebaseâ€™s limitations in scaling and data management posed issues, while the transition to MongoDB introduced unexpected complexities. Additionally, as a solo developer, time constraints hindered the ability to properly manage these changes, leading to the project's eventual failure.
